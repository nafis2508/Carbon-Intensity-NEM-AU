## Project Overview

This repository contains my work for the **Business Analytics Project** as part of my Master of Business Analytics studies at Macquarie University.

Our team advanced to the **final round** and achieved **runner-up overall** based on the strength of our analysis for **Question 2**, which examined:

> **How does intra-daily generator bidding behaviour affect carbon emission intensity, and can we identify the most carbon-efficient time blocks for electricity usage in Australia‚Äôs National Electricity Market (NEM)?**

Our findings aimed to guide both household and business users on how to reduce their carbon footprint through smarter electricity consumption patterns.

## Our Journey to the Finals

- üìä **Project Scope:** Our group analyzed 5 years of data from the CSIRO Emissions Intensity API, exploring intra-daily patterns in carbon emissions across NEM regions.
- üîç **My Contribution (Question 2):**
  - Collected and merged hourly carbon intensity and generator bidding data.
  - Built visualizations showing hourly emission curves by generation technology (renewables, hydro, fossil fuels).
  - Identified low-emission windows suitable for business and household consumption.
  - Created supply curves highlighting how bidding behaviour varies by time of day.
- üèÜ **Recognition:** Our team was selected as a finalist and ultimately earned the **runner-up** position in the unit competition, judged by Carley Beever, Corrine Li, and Linda Carlanita from Snowy Hydro.

## Key Results

‚úÖ Identified low-emission time blocks (particularly midday in SA and TAS) ideal for shifting electricity usage.

‚úÖ Found strong time-of-day patterns in fossil-fuel bidding behaviour, contributing to peak emission periods.

‚úÖ Developed recommendations for demand management and renewable deployment to reduce carbon intensity.

## Why This Matters

Understanding intra-daily carbon emission patterns is crucial for:

- Reducing greenhouse gas emissions
- Supporting sustainable energy consumption
- Informing policy and market strategies in the Australian energy sector

Our project provides actionable insights for businesses and households aiming to align electricity usage with lower-emission periods.
